Arma 3 Plans:

User opens A3 Option on the loader

3 buttons


button 1 = wasteland menu
button 2 =  exile
button 3 = KoTH



each button will copy the code for the menu onto the users clipboard, then they can do what they wish with it.
clicking the button will (hopefully) access an FTP or my website files, retreive the latest version of the menu an then copy it to the users clipboard

this is my plan for the "live update system" that doesnt require any redownloading of the loader.
